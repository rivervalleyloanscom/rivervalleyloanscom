There are a lot of places you can go to get a business loan, but they typically fall into two categories: Traditional lenders (banks and credit unions) and online lenders (alternative lenders).

If you want to shop for fast short-term business loans, online lenders can usually move more quickly to get money into your account. Sometimes, you can get a fast business loan in as little as 24 hours. Online lenders also tend to provide accessible financing options that are an option for business owners with bad credit.

But that speed and accessibility come at a price. Traditional banks can take days or weeks to provide funds to customers. But they generally offer lower rates since they take on less risk, working primarily with business owners with good and excellent credit.
